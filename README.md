melonnotifier - A very simple, hackable libnotify notification daemon for X
written in Go.

## INSTALLATION

`go get github.com/onodera-punpun/melonnotifier`


## USAGE

So the idea is that the look of the notification is very "easy" to configure by
just modifying the source code, Ã  la suckless.

The most important parts of the notification such as the position, width and
font are configurable in `main.go`.
